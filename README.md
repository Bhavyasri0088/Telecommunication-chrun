📞 Telecommunication Customer Churn Analysis - README

📌 Project Title:
Telecommunication Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

✅ Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn in the telecommunication industry. The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to leave the service provider. This allows companies to implement proactive retention strategies.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning models
XGBoost: For boosting performance
Jupyter Notebook / IDE: Google Colab, Jupyter, or VS Code

📊 Dataset Description:
Source: The dataset contains details of telecom customers with their demographic, service usage, and contract details.
Columns:
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Male or Female
SeniorCitizen: Binary flag (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
Tenure: Number of months the customer stayed with the company
MonthlyCharges: Monthly subscription cost
TotalCharges: Total amount paid by the customer
Contract: Type of contract (Month-to-Month, One year, Two year)
PaymentMethod: Mode of payment
Churn: Target variable (Yes = churned, No = retained)

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Data Cleaning:
Handling missing values in TotalCharges by replacing them with median values.
Converting TotalCharges to numerical values.
Data Visualization:
Churn Distribution: Proportion of churned vs. retained customers.
Contract Type vs. Churn: Identifying which contract types have higher churn rates.
Payment Methods Impact: Analyzing payment methods contributing to churn.

Correlation Heatmap: Understanding feature correlation with churn.

🛠️ Model Building Steps:
Data Preprocessing:
Encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
Scaling numerical features using StandardScaler.
Feature Selection:
Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select important features.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Models used:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC-AUC Curve
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Grid Search and Randomized Search for model optimization.

📈 Results & Insights:
The XGBoost model achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 85.7% and an F1-score of 83.4%.
Key Findings:
Customers with Month-to-Month contracts were more likely to churn.
Higher MonthlyCharges were associated with a higher churn rate.
Customers paying via Electronic Check had the highest churn rate.
Longer tenure customers were less likely to churn.

🚀 How to Run the Project:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository_link>
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open the Telecom_Churn_Analysis.ipynb file and run the cells sequentially.

⚠️ Challenges Faced:
Class Imbalance: The churn dataset had fewer churn cases, leading to model bias.
Feature Correlation: Some features were highly correlated, leading to multicollinearity issues.
Overfitting: Complex models overfitted the training data, requiring regularization.

🔥 Future Improvements:
Use deep learning models (e.g., ANN or RNN) for better accuracy.
Incorporate time-series analysis to predict future churn trends.
Add customer sentiment analysis using NLP from reviews or support tickets.
